    "### Your task now is to construct a neural network (in Keras) that learns clasification on this data set. Try to optimize and regularize it with the methods you have learned in class and by going thrugh this notebook. What is the best validation dataset score you can achieve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you should take away from this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are trying to classify data points between N classes, your network should end with a Dense layer of size N.\n",
    "- In a single-label, multi-class classification problem, your network should end with a softmax activation, so that it will output a probability distribution over the N output classes.\n",
    "- Categorical crossentropy is almost always the loss function you should use for such problems. It minimizes the distance between the probability distributions output by the network, and the true distribution of the targets.\n",
    "- There are two ways to handle labels in multi-class classification: Encoding the labels via \"categorical encoding\" (also known as \"one-hot encoding\") and using categorical_crossentropy as your loss function. Encoding the labels as integers and using the sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function.\n",
    "- If you need to classify data into a large number of categories, then you should avoid creating information bottlenecks in your network by having intermediate layers that are too small."
